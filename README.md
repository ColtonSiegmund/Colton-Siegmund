## Description

I was motivated to build this site by the lack of a portfolio. I wanted a central location where friends, family, potential employers and clients could view my work in one location. It gives a great overview of what I am capable of, where I've come from, and what I am looking forward to next.

## Usage

The website is designed to be simple and user friendly. Clicking on any of the links at the top will take you to the proper section of the site or clicking on the resume will take you to an externally hosted resume.
